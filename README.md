Purpose:

The purpose of this website is to serve as an on-going platform where I can constantly make changes and show my progress through my journey to become a full stack web developer. It will allow prospective employers and peers to have a look into projects that I have made or that are currently being built. Alongside this, it will also serve as a platform as to where I can make blog posts and talk about my progress of my studies or even just something else that I may want to write about. 

Functionality: 

This website is designed using the baseline forms of HTML and CSS to provide a responsive, simple and accessible experience. The experience that is had will be tailored around the users device, be it phone, tablet or computer. Media queries are used to determine the CSS for the relevant device. Page layout is largely formatted by flex-boxes and appropriate positioning. HTML segments are setout and identified by semantic HTML tags. 

Functionality - Features:
-   Responsive layout through the use of mediaqueries.
-   Responsive navigation menu, for computer and tablet users they will experience a menu 
    navigation bar across the top of their screen. For mobile users, this navigation experience will be condensed into a hamburger menu for ease of use. 
-   On any platform the navigation menus will be sticky/fixed, this allows that no matter
    where the user is on the page, they have access to the menu.
-   The hamburger menu is attached to a simple script that creates a function based on the
    user clicking on the menu.
-   The color pallet was put together using the website www.cooler.com; I looked to this
    to inspire some design aesthetic to the website.
-   All pages have been created using flex boxes to help provide the overall layout for
    the website. 
-   On the desktop version on the website, menu navigation options will change colour based
    off mouse hover to show the selected option. 



Functionality - Features - Index.html
-   On the home/index page there is some simple keyframings animation set to reveal
    the header as if it were being typed out. 
-   Anchor tag link to the Coder Academy course
-   Blog and Project post previews on both the tablet and computer layouts with anchor

Target Audience:

The target audience of this website portfolio is primarily potential employers, however I want to make this website accessible for peers and also many other people that aren't even involved in the development industry. I would like to be able to share things that I have created with friends and family and be able to show them meaningful progress with my own development. 

Tech Stack:

The tech stack used is made up primarily of HTML and CSS, all the CSS styling is external to the html sheets to keep the code as clean as possible. One segment of inline JavaScript was used in the html sheets, this is to provide function for the clicking/tapping of the hamburger menu icon.
